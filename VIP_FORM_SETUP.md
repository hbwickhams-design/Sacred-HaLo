# Sacred HaLo - VIP Email List Setup Instructions

## ✅ FORM IS LIVE!

Your VIP email signup form is now live at the bottom of your website:
**https://sacredhaloconnection.com**

---

## 📋 What the Form Collects:

1. **Name** (required)
2. **Email** (required)
3. **Phone** (optional)
4. **How did you hear about Sacred HaLo?** (optional)
5. **Timestamp** (automatic)

## 📊 NEXT STEP: Connect to Google Sheets

Right now, the form shows a success message but doesn't save data anywhere yet.

### Option 1: Manual Collection (Temporary)
For now, the form works and shows "Thank you!" messages. You can manually track customers through Calendly until we connect Google Sheets.

### Option 2: Connect Google Sheets (Recommended)

**I'll need to set up a Google Sheets webhook for you. Here's what we need:**

1. **Create a Google Sheet** for customer data
2. **Set up Google Apps Script** to receive form submissions
3. **Get the webhook URL** and add it to your website
4. **Test the connection**

**Would you like me to walk you through this?** Or we can set it up together in a follow-up session.

## 📧 Alternative: Use Mailchimp Instead

**Easier option:** Connect form directly to Mailchimp
- Signups go straight to your email list
- You can send campaigns immediately
- Free up to 500 contacts

Let me know which you prefer and I'll set it up!

## 🎯 For Now: Form is Live

Customers can fill it out and see a success message. 
You'll need to track responses manually through Calendly until we connect the backend.
